### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Managing and provisioning computer data centers/ infra through code.
- Types
	- Declarative
	- Imperative 

- With ARM templates you can: 
	- ARM templates are declarative. (you get exactly what you define) 
	- stand up, tear down or share entire architectures in minutes 
	- Reduce configuration mistakes 
	- Establish an architecture baseline for compliance 
	- **Modularity** Break up your architecture in multiple files and reuse them 
	- **Extensibility** Add PowerShell and Bash scripts to your templates 
	- Testing You can use the ARM template tool kit (arm-ttk) 
	- Preview Changes Before you create infrastructure via template, see what it will create 
	- **Built-In Validation** Will only deploy your template if it passes 
	- Tracked Deployments Keep track of changes to architecture over time 
	- **Policy as Code** Apply Azure policies to ensure you remain compliant 
	- **Microsoft Blueprints** (establishes relationship between resource and the template) 
	- **Cl/CD integration**
	- Exportable Code (exporting the current state of a resource groups and resources) 
	- Authoring Tools Visual Studio Code has advanced features for authoring ARM templates

### Azure Resource Management 
- ARM templates are declarative in nature. You get exactly what you have defined.
- ARM JSON templates consists of
	- Schema
		- Describes the proeprties that are available within a template
	- Content Version
		- Version of the template
	- Api Profile
		- Use this property to avoid having to provide the API version
	- Parameters
		- Input parameters such as resource name, location and similar input parameters are generally part of this section.
		- Allows passing of the variables to the ARM templates
		- types of parameters 
			- string, securestring, int, bool, object, secureObject and array
	- Functions 
		- Built-in functions on datatypes and other object of ARM template and user defined functions.
		- 
	- Variables
		- Constants that can be used in the template, these are reusable. 
		- Variables can be nested
	- Outputs
		- Output of the functions, useful when nesting another template
	- Resources
		- Resources that are to be deployed or updated
		- General sections of the Resource
			- type 
				- Type of the azure resource, could be a VM or database
			- apiVersion
				- version of the REST API to use for the resource
			- name
			- location
			- other properties
